\title{Make Open-High-Low-Close-Volume bars}
\usage{
makeOHLCV(pData, on = "minutes", k = 5, tz = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pData}{data.table or xts object to make the bars out of, containing the intraday price series of a stock for possibly multiple days.}

\item{on}{character, indicating the time scale in which "k" is expressed. Possible values are: "secs", "seconds", "mins", "minutes", "hours".}

\item{k}{positive numeric, indicating the number of periods to aggregate over. E.g. to aggregate an
object to the 5 minute frequency set k = 5 and on = "minutes".}

\item{tz}{time zone used, by default: tz = "GMT".}
}
\description{
This function makes OHLC-V bars at arbitrary intevals. If the SIZE column is not present in the input, no volume column is created.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
minuteBars <- makeOHLCV(sampleTDataEurope, on = "minutes", k = 1)
## We can use the quantmod package's chartSeries function to plot the ohlcv data
quantmod::chartSeries(minuteBars)

minuteBars <- makeOHLCV(sampleTDataEurope[,], on = "minutes", k = 1)
## Again we plot the series with chartSeries
quantmod::chartSeries(minuteBars)

## We can also handle data across multiple days.
fiveMinuteBars <- makeOHLCV(sampleTDataMicroseconds)
## Again we plot the series with chartSeries
quantmod::chartSeries(fiveMinuteBars)

## We can use arbitrary k, here we choose pi
bars <- makeOHLCV(sampleTDataEurope, on = "seconds", k = pi)
## Again we plot the series with chartSeries
quantmod::chartSeries(bars)
}

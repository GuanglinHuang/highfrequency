\usage{
rankJumpTest(
  marketPrice,
  stockPrices,
  alpha = c(5, 3),
  K = 10,
  kn = 30,
  r = 1,
  BoxCox = 1,
  nBoot = 1000,
  dontTestAtBoundaries = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{numeric significance level to use for the jump tests.}

\item{marketReturns}{data.table or xts containing the}

\item{testType}{type of test to use. Currently supports "LM" test of Lee and Mykland (2018), and "FoF" as "Fact or Friction" test from Christensen, Oomen, and Podolskij (2014)}

\item{testingTimes}{a character vector of times to test for jumps, for example  \code{c("11:30", "11:35", "14:30")}. 
This argument can also be a numeric vector containing times to test in seconds after midnight. For example, using \code{seq(39200, 57600, 300)}, 
where testing will take place every five minutes, starting fifty minutes after opening. (On when open is 09:30). This argument is not used in the FoF type test.}

\item{theta}{numeric parameter in determining the pre-averaging horizon. Default = 0.5. The pre-averaging horizon is \code{round(theta * sqrt(n))}, where n is the number of observations. 
This parameter will also help determine the testing times as the test is done on non-overlapping pre-averaged returns.}

\item{...}{used internally. Don't set this parameter.}
